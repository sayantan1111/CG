## Overview

The first week was dedicated to understanding the core syntax and essential building blocks of the Java programming language. We covered how to write simple Java programs, handle different types of data, control the flow of execution, and work with fundamental data structures like arrays and strings, as well as modularizing code with functions (methods).

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Introduction to Java

- What is Java?
- History and importance of Java
- Setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Writing and running the first Java program ("Hello, World!")
- Understanding the basic structure of a Java program (classes, main method)

### Day 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators

- Declaring and initializing variables
- Primitive data types (int, double, boolean, char, etc.)
- Non-primitive data types (String – introduced briefly)
- Understanding Java operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment)
- Type casting

### Day 3: Control Flow (Conditional Statements and Loops)

- if, else if, else statements
- switch statement
- for loops
- while loops
- do-while loops
- break and continue statements

### Day 4: Arrays

- What are arrays?
- Declaring and initializing arrays
- Accessing array elements
- Iterating through arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays

### Day 5: Strings

- Introduction to the String class
- Creating String objects
- Common String methods (e.g., length(), charAt(), substring(), equals(), equalsIgnoreCase())
- String concatenation
- String immutability

### Day 6: Functions (Methods)

- What are functions/methods?
- Defining and calling methods
- Method parameters and return types
- Method overloading
- Understanding static and void keywords
