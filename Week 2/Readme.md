# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Core Concepts

Welcome to Week 2 of our Java learning journey! This week focused on understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and important Java keywords like `this`, `static`, and `final`.

## Overview

This week we focused on strengthening our understanding of Javaâ€™s object model and OOP design. We wrote and organized Java programs using principles like encapsulation and inheritance, while also learning how to structure and initialize objects properly. We also touched upon foundational OOP design principles to write cleaner, reusable code.
